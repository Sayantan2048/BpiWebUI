# BpiWebUI
BananaPi web based management interface.

I developed this web UI for my family, who don't know how to use ssh or console. You can perform variety of management tasks by simply 
opening a browser from any device.

What you can do with WebUI(also take a look at the screenshots):  
1. Mount/Unmount and view filesystems.  
2. View system stats.  
3. Turn on/off GPIO pins.  
4. Star/stop services like smbd, nmbd, aria2c and many more con be added.  

Requirements:
WiringBP, Apache Tomcat 8 or higher, installed commands like blkid, df, mount, umount and some custom built programs for GPIO.
